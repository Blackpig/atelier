# Block Builder

The Block Builder lets you build the content of a page by stacking sections — called **blocks** — on top of each other. Each block is a self-contained piece of content: a hero banner, a text section, an image paired with text, an embedded video, and so on.

## How it works

A page is made up of one or more blocks displayed in order from top to bottom. You decide which blocks appear, what they contain, and how they look — all from the **Content Blocks** tab on any page you're editing.

You can:
- Add new blocks using the **Add Content Block** button
- Reorder blocks by dragging them
- Edit each block's content and appearance individually
- Publish or hide individual blocks without deleting them

## Where to find it

Open any page in the admin panel and click the **Content Blocks** tab.

## Block types

The following block types are available:

| Block | Description |
|---|---|
| **Hero Section** | Full-width banner with a background image, headline, and optional subtitle |
| **Text** | Rich text content with full formatting options |
| **Text + Image** | Text content paired with a single image, side by side or stacked |
| **Text with Two Images** | Rich text with two accompanying images in various layouts |
| **Video** | Embed videos from YouTube, Vimeo, or other platforms |

## Before you start

> **Important:** Changes to blocks are not saved automatically. After adding, editing, or reordering blocks, you must click the **Save changes** button at the bottom of the page to keep your work.

The chapters in this section walk you through everything you need to know to manage your page content confidently.

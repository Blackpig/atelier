# Call to Action

A **Call to Action** (CTA) is a button that links visitors to another page, a download, or any other URL. CTAs are used to guide visitors towards the next step — "Read more", "Get in touch", "Book now", and so on.

## Which blocks support CTAs?

Not every block type includes a Call to Action section. When it is available, you'll see a **Call to Action** section in the block editor, with an **Add Call to Action** button.

## Adding a CTA

1. Open the block editor by clicking the **pen icon** on a block
2. Scroll to the **Call to Action** section
3. Click **Add Call to Action**
4. Fill in the CTA fields (see below)
5. Click **Save Changes** to close the editor, then **Save changes** on the page to save everything

## CTA fields

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Label** | The button text visitors will see — for example, "Learn more" or "Contact us" |
| **URL** | The link the button points to — can be a relative path (`/about`) or a full URL (`https://example.com`) |
| **Style** | The visual style of the button — Primary, Secondary, or Alternate |
| **New Tab** | When turned on, the link opens in a new browser tab |

## Multiple CTAs

You can add more than one CTA to a block. Each one appears as its own row in the Call to Action section. To change the order, drag the rows using their handles.

## Removing a CTA

To remove a CTA, click the delete icon on the right of its row. Then save the block editor and save the page as usual.

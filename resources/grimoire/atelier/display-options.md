# Display Options

Every block has a **Display Options** section that controls how the block looks on the page — independently of its content. You'll find it at the bottom of the block editor, collapsed by default. Click the section heading to expand it.

## Quick Edit shortcut

For fast access to the two most common display settings — background colour and block divider — you can use the **Quick Edit Colours** panel instead of opening the full editor.

Hover over a block in the block list and click the **sliders icon**. A small panel will appear with:

- **Background Color** — the section background
- **Divider** — the decorative shape at the bottom of the block
- **Next Section Color** — the background colour of the next section (used to match the divider colour correctly)

Changes made here are reflected in the full Display Options section and vice versa.

## Background Color

Sets the background colour of the entire block section. The available colour options are configured specifically for your site — the names and number of choices will vary. You might see options such as White, Light Gray, or a Primary brand colour, but your site may use different names or have additional choices.

## Spacing Mode

Controls how the vertical padding around the block is applied:

- **Balanced** — equal spacing above and below the block
- **Individual** — set the top and bottom spacing separately

## Spacing

Sets how much breathing room appears above and below the block's content. Options range from None through to XL.

A larger spacing value creates more visual separation between sections and helps the page feel less cramped.

## Width

Controls how wide the block's content area is within the page:

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| Container | Standard page width |
| Narrow | Tighter content column, good for text-heavy sections |
| Wide | Wider than standard, useful for image-heavy layouts |
| Full | Edge-to-edge, no margins |

## Block Divider

Adds a decorative shape to the **bottom edge** of the block, creating a visual transition into the next section. The available divider shapes are configured for your site — you might find options such as diagonal cuts, curves, waves, or a triangle, but the exact selection depends on what has been set up for your project.

The divider colour is automatically based on the **Next Section Color** setting — set that to match the background of the block that follows, and the transition will look seamless.

# Managing Blocks

The **Content Blocks** tab shows every block on the current page, stacked in the order they appear on the frontend.

## The block list

Each row in the block list shows:

- **Drag handle** (the lines on the far left) — grab this to reorder the block
- **Block type icon** — a coloured icon showing the block type
- **Block type name** — for example, "Text" or "Hero Section"
- **Status badge** — either **Draft** (amber) or **Published** (green)
- **Preview text** — a short description or title to help you identify the block

## Hover actions

When you hover over a block row, four icons appear on the right:

| Icon | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Sliders** | Opens the Quick Edit Colours panel — change background colour and block divider without opening the full editor |
| **Eye** | Toggles the block between Published and Draft instantly, with no modal required |
| **Pen** | Opens the full block editor where you can update content, settings, and display options |
| **Trash** | Permanently deletes the block — this cannot be undone |

## Reordering blocks

Drag a block by its handle (the lines icon on the left of the row) to move it up or down. The order you see in the list is the order visitors will see on the page.

## Draft vs Published

A block set to **Draft** will not appear on the frontend — it's invisible to visitors. Use this to prepare content in advance or temporarily hide a section without deleting it.

A block set to **Published** is live and visible to everyone.

You can toggle the status instantly using the **eye icon** on hover, or use the Published toggle inside the full block editor.

## Adding a new block

Click the **Add Content Block** button below the block list. A modal will appear showing all available block types — click one to add it to the page.

The new block will be added to the bottom of the list. You can then edit it and drag it into position.

## Saving your changes

> **Important:** Saving inside a block editor does **not** save the page. After adding, editing, or reordering blocks, you must click the **Save changes** button at the bottom of the page to keep your work. If you navigate away without saving, your changes will be lost.

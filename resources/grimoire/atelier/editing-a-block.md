# Editing a Block

To edit a block, hover over it in the block list and click the **pen icon**. This opens the block editor in a side panel.

## Language switcher

If your site supports multiple languages, a language switcher appears at the top of the editor. Use it to switch between languages and edit the translated content for the currently selected language.

Fields that support translation — such as headings and body text — will update to show the content for whichever language is selected. Non-translatable fields (such as display options) remain the same across all languages.

## Published toggle

Near the top of the editor you'll find the **Published** toggle.

- **On (Published)** — the block is visible to visitors on the frontend
- **Off (Draft)** — the block is hidden from visitors

Use Draft when you're working on a block that isn't ready to go live yet, or to temporarily hide a section without deleting it.

## Content section

The **Content** section contains the main fields for the block — for example, a heading, body text, or image. The exact fields shown depend on the block type.

Refer to the individual block type guides (coming soon) for details on what each field does.

## Settings section

The **Settings** section contains layout controls that are specific to the block type — for example, text alignment, number of columns, or image position.

These are also covered in the individual block type guides.

## Display Options section

The **Display Options** section controls the visual appearance of the block — background colour, spacing, width, and decorative dividers. These settings apply to all block types.

See the [Display Options](/help/atelier/display-options) guide for a full explanation of each field.

## Call to Action section

Some block types include a **Call to Action** section, which lets you add one or more buttons to the block. See the [Call to Action](/help/atelier/call-to-action) guide for details.

## Saving

The block editor has its own **Save Changes** and **Cancel** buttons at the bottom.

- **Save Changes** — saves the content inside the editor and closes the panel
- **Cancel** — closes the panel without saving any edits

> **Remember:** Saving inside the block editor does **not** save the page. After closing the editor, you must click the **Save changes** button at the bottom of the page to keep all your changes.
